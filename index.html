  <p>
    Well, I've always wanted to get into Tech, the idea has been in my head since like late 2022, so i told a close friend of mine
    (Alex) in computer science about it
    back then and he was able to link me up
     with one of his other friend in the department who was into Web Dev, after
      a bit of time, he got me started, gave me some free websites where i could learn, 
    i think it was w3schools, that was the name of the website but after taking the course for a 
    while i stopped cuz i was not getting motivations and all. Fast forward to like middle of 2023, 
    so Alex was on my neck about
    me backing out of the course, so i resumed but this time it was with freeCodeCamp, but then i was 
    battling with taking it serious cuz it was just me, Alex was into Game Dev and 
    i really don't know any other web dev.
    I Struggled to complete HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp but that was it, 
    I never really put it into practice and build projects, i just learnt the course and stopped, not until late 
    2024 around august, Alex came again and this time it 
    more of an abuse about me not taking my life serious, so he asked some of his 
    friends around about a better place where i could learn web dev and at the same time be in a community that
     would keep me motivated, so they told him about ALTSCHOOL AFRICA and i decided to join the program,
    I Haven;t been taking the classes due to financial issues(alot to explain) but yeah, that was why i joined,  to make a better living for myself.
